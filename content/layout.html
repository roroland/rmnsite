    <h3>Layout</h3>

  <p>
    I build rock-solid
    HTML semantic
    and accesible structures made for last,
    using most modern and robust layout techniques available,
    like Flex
    and Grid, but also focus of being able to gracefully
    degrade for less
    capable or older browsers, delivering the best possible
    experience
    for all your users.</p>

  <p>A strong foundation means a faster site, easily scalable
    and
    with a lower learning curve when sharing the code with
    other
    teams.</p>
  <p class="all-span">I build <strong>rock-solid</strong>
    structures from scratch.</p>
  <p>
    I code in <strong>Javascript</strong> for
    user-oriented interactions, light logic and most common
    every-day tasks for a front-end developer.<br>
    I have tons of experience
    integrating
    HTML markup within most modern
    front-end framework technologies like Angular, Vue and
    Rails.<br>
    Also I
    build or modify themes in CMS like Wordpress, Shopify
    and static
    sites generators like Jekyll.</p>
